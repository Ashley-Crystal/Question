# Question

One of the best ideas to start experimenting with hands-on NLP projects for students is working on a media monitor. In the modern business environment, user opinion is a crucial denominator of your brand’s success. Customers can openly share how they feel about your products on social media and other digital platforms. Therefore, today’s businesses want to track online mentions of their brand. The most significant fillip to these monitoring efforts has come from the use of machine learning. 

For example, the analytics platform Keyhole can filter all the posts in your social media stream and provide you with a sentiment timeline that displays the positive, neutral, or negative opinion. Similarly, an ML-backed sift through news sites. Take the case of the financial sector where organisations can apply NLP to gauge the sentiment about their company from digital news sources. 
Such media analytics can also improve customer service. For example, providers of financial services can monitor and gain insights from relevant news events (such as oil spills) to assist clients who have holdings in that industry. 


Develop a media monitor software (app or website), wherein if we enter a company's name, the public sentiment/opinion around that company can be inferred, with sufficient amount of documentation. 
You can use any languages or frameworks of your choice. Our recommendation is using Python Web Scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup, etc.
